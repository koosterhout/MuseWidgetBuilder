# Muse Widget Builder
This simple app allows for building simple and straightforward widgets with Muse.

## Electron and Node JS installed?
Running the app is simple, from the app dir, run: electron .

## No time for all that nerd stuff?
Use the Windows installer (I need to upload that somewhere), building for Mac is apparently impossible from Windows ( https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/issues/164).
